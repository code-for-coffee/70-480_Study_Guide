# *Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript & CSS3*
## Study Guide


This repository is a markdown version of notes for Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 (which is a Microsoft certification exam). It is completely platform-agnostic and focused on the use of newer HTML5/CSS3/Javascript features. This study guide was originally created by <a href="https://github.com/Mellbourn?tab=repositories">@Mellbourn</a>. I have merely taken the notes and converted them to Markdown for easier reading. You can visit the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RmVrbbMBZ4-mg8P4BHRuXZrTtpKv5eOieA5UHXgWw5M/edit#">original Google Document here</a>. While this guide was originally written for exam prep, it can always be used to introduce some of the newer features of the web to developers.
